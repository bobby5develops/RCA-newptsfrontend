Majority IL properties typically include services such as communal dining, housekeeping, transportation, emergency call, and social programming services in the monthly fee.</li><li><u>Majority Assisted Living (AL)</u>: A property that has a plurality of assisted living and/or memory care service units. Residents receive personal care services such as assistance with bathing, dressing, eating, walking, and toileting. Twenty-four-hour protective oversight is provided, but 24-hour medical care is not.

This can also be referred to as segment or service type units/beds. One unit of IL, AL, or MC is counted as equivalent to one NC bed.</li><li><u>Independent Living (IL)</u>: The part or section of a property that provides independent living services.
